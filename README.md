# Ocaml-simple-project
The project aims to provide the interpreter of a functional teaching language with the new Dictionary type. The new type "Dictionary" is a set of pairs (key, value) and ApplyOver, Get,Set,Remove,Clear represent the operations that can be performed on a dictionary. If the parameter they must operate on is not a dictionary (DictVal) they will fail their evaluation.
